## 📋 Project Briefs

### 🎥 VideoHub - Full-Stack Video Platform
**Tech Stack:** Django REST APIs, ReactJS, SQLite, JWT Authentication  
**Description:** Built a complete YouTube-like platform with video upload/streaming capabilities, secure JWT-based authentication, and CORS-configured frontend-backend communication. Demonstrates end-to-end full-stack development with modern web technologies.
**Repository:** [github.com/Rishabjain12-glitch/videohub](https://github.com/Rishabjain12-glitch/videohub)

### 🤖 Document QA Chatbot - RAG-Powered Intelligence
**Tech Stack:** Python, Streamlit, Ollama, Vector Embeddings, LLMs  
**Description:** Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that processes multi-format documents (CSV, Excel, PDF, TXT), builds semantic search indexes using local embeddings, and enables intelligent Q&A through conversational AI. Optimized for CPU-only environments with session-based chat history.
**Repository:** [github.com/Rishabjain12-glitch/document-qa](https://github.com/Rishabjain12-glitch/document-qa)

### 🎙️ LiveKit Agentic Voice Interrupt Handler
**Tech Stack:** LiveKit, Speech-to-Text, Voice Activity Detection (VAD), Python  
**Description:** Engineered an intelligent interrupt-handling pipeline for real-time voice AI agents. Implemented sophisticated filtering logic to suppress benign backchannel words ("yeah", "ok", "hmm") while preserving critical hard commands ("stop", "wait", "no"). Optimized voice interaction naturalness by reducing false interruptions and improving agent responsiveness.
**Key Achievement:** Designed VAD and STT processing with stateful interrupt logic, making voice agents more conversational and less reactive to casual acknowledgments.
**Status:** Completed assignment - December 2025

### 📊 Magic Bus Data Analyst Chatbot
**Tech Stack:** Python, AI/ML, Data Processing  
**Description:** Built an interactive chatbot for dataset analysis and insight extraction. Enables users to upload datasets and query them conversationally, providing data-driven answers and actionable insights through natural language interfaces.
**Repository:** [github.com/Rishabjain12-glitch/Magic-Bus-Data-analyst-Chatbot](https://github.com/Rishabjain12-glitch/Magic-Bus-Data-analyst-Chatbot)
